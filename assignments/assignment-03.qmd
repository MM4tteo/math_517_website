Create a [Shiny App](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/) or (alternatively) an R Markdown report exploring the (global, asymptotically optimal) bandwidth choice $h_{AMISE}$ on slides 19 and 20 on a simulated data example:

-   covariate $X$ from beta distribution `rbeta(n,shape1,shape2)`
-   response values $Y = m(X) + \epsilon$ where
    -   the regression function $m$ is given by `sin(1/(x/3+0.1))`
    -   $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$
-   fix $\sigma^2$ at some visually appealing value (e.g. $\sigma^2=1$ should be fine)
-   explore how $h_{AMISE}$ behaves depending on the following parameters (in case of a Shiny App, these will be sliders for the user to tweak):
    -   sample size `n`
    -   block size `N`
    -   density of the covariate: beta parameters `shape1` and `shape2`
-   visualize (global, asymptotically optimal) bandwidth
    -   also find a way to visually incorporate the beta density


# TODO: 
- [ ] add a link to ruppert, sheather, wand jasa 1995 for optimal choice of N
- [ ] add content of slides 19 and 20 from lecture 4
