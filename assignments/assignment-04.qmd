Consider a subset of `mcycle` data (of the `MASS` package)[^1] for `times` $\leq 40$ and use cross-validation to select

-  the polynomial degree of $p$ from candidate values $p=1,2,3$, and
-  the bandwidth $h$ from candidate values $h=3,4,\ldots,15$

for a local polynomial smoother[^2].

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center',out.width="70%"}
library(MASS)
library(ggplot2)
data(mcycle)
mcycle <- mcycle[mcycle$times <= 40, ]

ggplot() +
    theme_bw() +
    geom_point(data=mcycle, aes(x=times, y=accel)) +
    labs(x="time after impact (ms)", y="acceleration (g)", title="Simulated Motorcycle Accident Data")
```

**Notes**:

-  Use your own visualizations to verify your progress
-  You may run into issues for large $p$ and small $h$ if you use small number of folds.
-  Beware of how your points are ordered.
