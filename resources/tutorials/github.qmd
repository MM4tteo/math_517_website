First follow this [set up Git tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) and then follow [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) to get a gentle introduction to Git and GitHub.

**Summary of the steps**

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
2. [Install Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git#setting-up-git)

If all of the above worked, you are ready to go.
